### Python Implementation of PLDA Scoring used in speaker recognition and diarization
> This code is the python implementation of PLDA scoring used in [Kaldi CALLHOME Diarization recipe](https://kaldi-asr.org/models/m6).  
> It uses a pre-trained plda model from the Kaldi recipe and generates PLDA scores using X-vectors of one recording from CALLHOME dataset.  
> It compares the scores with cosine similarity scores.

## Prerequisites:
Python >= 3.6

## Implementation
Run following command
```sh
python main.py
```
